# Practices of ML/DS

This project focuses on practicing the basics of Machine Learning and Data Science. It is based on the course [Complete A.I. Machine Learning and Data Science: Zero to Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/machine-learning-and-data-science-bootcamp/).

## Projects

- Supervised Learning (Classification)
- Supervised Learning (Time series data)
- Neural Network (Dog breed vision)

## Getting Started

1. Ensure Python is installed.
2. Open this project in VSCode.
3. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Jupyter notebook directly in VSCode (Jupyter extension is required).
5. Alternatively, start the Jupyter notebook in your browser by running `jupyter notebook`.
6. In neural-network project, the notebook should be running on Google Colab for GPU acceleration.
